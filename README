FuseISOMenu KDE Service Menu
by Jason Farrell <farrellj@gmail.com>, 2008

DESCRIPTION:
------------------------------
FuseISOMenu is a simple front-end menu to "fuseiso", which must also be
installed. It allows regular non-root users to easily mount and unmount CD/DVD
ISO images of various formats. Currently supports plain ISO9660 Level 1 and 2,
Rock Ridge, Joliet, zisofs. Supported image types: ISO, BIN (single track
only), NRG, MDF, IMG (CCD).

note: in many distributions each user must first be added to the "fuse" group
(and then re-login) before he has permission to use fuse.

Menu items: Actions > "FuseISO Mount/Unmount"
- AutoMount here (./FUSEMNT-isofilename)
- AutoMount to Desktop (~/Desktop/FUSEMNT-isofilename)
- Mount here...
- Mount to Desktop...
- Unmount
- Unmount All
- Show All Mounts
- Help


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Extract, then run the installer ("./install_fuseisomenu").  The installer
script simply copies the menu and script to the following existing directories
for it to be picked up by both Konqueror & Dolphin:
~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus
~/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus
~/.kde/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus


USAGE:
To mount:
    Select one or more ISO images, then rightclick and choose Actions > FuseISO > ...:
    - "AutoMount here (./FUSEMNT-isofilename)" --  automounts to a temporary directory named FUSEMNT-isofilename in the same directory as the ISO image.
    - "AutoMount to Desktop (~/Desktop/FUSEMNT-isofilename)" --  automounts to a temp directory on the Desktop
    - "Mount here..." --  mounts to a temp directory you choose
    - "Mount to Desktop..." --  mounts to a temp directory you choose, on the Desktop
To unmount:
    select one or more ISO images, or their current mountpoints, then rightclick and choose Actions > FuseISO > Unmount
